//Exercise
 //       Write a program where the program chooses a number between 1 and 100.
//  The player is then asked to enter a guess.
// If the player guesses wrong, then the program gives feedback and
// ask to enter an other guess until the guess is correct.
//        Make the range customizable (ask for it before starting the guessing).
//        You can add lives. (optional)
//       Example
//        I've the number between 1-100. You have 5 lives.
//        20
//        Too high. You have 4 lives left.
//        10
//        Too low. You have 3 lives left.
//        15
//        Congratulations. You won!
