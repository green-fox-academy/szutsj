//Create a class that represents an aircraft-carrier
//
//    The carrier should be able to store aircrafts
//    Each carrier should have a store of ammo represented as number
//    The inital ammo should be given by a parameter in it's constructor
//    The carrier also has a health point given in it's constructor as well
//
//    Methods:
//    add
//
//    It should take a new aircraft and add it to its store
//
//    fill
//
//    It should fill all the aircraft with ammo and substract the needed ammo from the ammo storage
//    If there is not enough ammo than it should start to fill the aircraftis with priority first
//    If there is no ammo when this method is called it should throw an exception
//
//    fight
//
//    It should take another carrier as a refrence parameter and fire all the ammo from the aircrafts to it, than substract all the damage from it's health points
//
//    getStatus
//
//    It should give back a string about it's and all of its aircrafts status like:
//
//    HP: 5000, Aircraft count: 5, Ammo Storage: 2300, Total damage: 2280
//    Aircrafts:
//    Type F35, Ammo: 12, Base Damage: 50, All Damage: 600
//    Type F35, Ammo: 12, Base Damage: 50, All Damage: 600
//    Type F35, Ammo: 12, Base Damage: 50, All Damage: 600
//    Type F16, Ammo: 8, Base Damage: 30, All Damage: 240
//    Type F16, Ammo: 8, Base Damage: 30, All Damage: 240
//
//    If the health points are 0 than it should give back: It's dead Jim :(
